## Get Free, and Reliable Financial Market Data - Machine Learning-Ready

Ever tried to build a machine learning model for stock forecasting, only to hit 
a wall when it comes to finding good data? You're not alone. Getting reliable 
economic and financial market data without spending a fortune can be tough, 
and there are plenty of unreliable sources out there.

I'll show you how to automatically collect daily data and prepare it for
